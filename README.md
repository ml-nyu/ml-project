## Description
This repository contains the Project files for the twitter bot detection.
In this project we have used two approaches to identify bot
accounts. 
We first analyze features and identify those features
that help get the best accuracy from the classifier. 
We then discussed two algorithms Naive Bayes and Random Forest
that will be used to identify these bot accounts using the
features selected. 
We also analyzed the performance of each
classifier and found that random forest works well with an
accuracy of 91.67 percent. 
We also discussed improvements
that can be made in the evaluation section.
